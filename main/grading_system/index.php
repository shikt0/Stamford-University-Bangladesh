    <h1>Evaluation Procedures</h1>
    <p>The performance of a student in any course will be evaluated on the basis of class attendance, in course/class test/class assessment, assignments/term papers/case, mid-term and semester final examinations.</p>
    <strong>For All Programs:</strong>
    <p>A theory course will be divided into two parts for teaching and the course evaluation as follows:</p>

    <div class="table_wrapper">
        <table border="1">
            <tr>
                <th>1st Part</th>
                <th></th>

    <p>* For a 3 credit hours course minimum four class tests need to be taken and best two of them will be considered for evaluation. For a 2 credit hours course minimum three class tests need to be taken and best two of them will be considered for evaluation.</p>
    <p>** After the completion of the midterm examination, the 1st part of the course would be considered completed and would not be carried for semester final examination.</p>


    <h1>Grading System</h1>
    <p>The performance of a student in a given course is made through continuous evaluation that comprises quizzes/ in-course, class participation, attendance, home work/assignment, case study, mid-term and semester final examinations.</p>

    <p>Letter grades and grade points are used to evaluate the performance of a student in a given course. A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C and D are the passing grades while F is the failing grade. Grade ‘I’ is incomplete and grade ‘W’ is for withdraw. The numerical grades used in calculating the GPA/CGPA (Cumulative grade point average) are as follows:</p>

    <h1>Calculation of GPA/ CGPA</h1>
    <p>Grade Point Average (GPA) or Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is the average of the grade points obtained in all the courses passed/completed by a student. For example, if a student passes/completes four courses in a semester having credit hours of C1, C2, C3 & C4 and his/her grade points in these courses are G1, G2, G3 & G4 respectively then Suppose a student got grade point "4.0" in a 3 Credit hours course and 3.0 in 1.5 credit hours course then his/her GPA/CGPA will be as follows</p>

    <h1>Earned Credit Hours</h1>
    <p>The course in which a student has obtained "D" or higher grade will be counted as earned credit hours. Any course in which a student has obtained "F" grade will not be counted towards his/her earned credit. In that case he/she will have to repeat the course. "F" grade will not be counted for GPA calculation.</p>
